        <description>Fedora Infrastructure is currently ongoing migration to different datacenter, during this migration majority of the contributor-facing services will be down.
Therefore it is expected that sync-release (i.e., propose-downstream and pull-from-upstream), koji_build, and bodhi_update Packit workflows will be affected.
Copr build jobs may be disrupted, full outage is not expected.
For more details watch:
 Fedora Infrastructure Status Tracking issue for the datacenter move  Update - 4th July Most services in Fedora Infrastructure should be up and running again.</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update---4th-july&#34;&gt;Update - 4th July&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most services in Fedora Infrastructure should be up and running again.
Packit has resumed processing &lt;code&gt;copr_build&lt;/code&gt; jobs, but there are still delays due to jobs being queued during the outage in previous days.
We are continuing to investigate issues related to pushing and pulling from dist-git, which are currently impacting downstream jobs.
We’ll share further updates as soon as we have more information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>SRPM builds in Copr have been failing, the reason is still unknown, please be patient. You can monitor #buildsys:fedoraproject.org on Matrix for updates.
Update: Copr SRPM builds are working again. You can retrigger failed jobs with /packit build or /packit rebuild-failed.</description>

        <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s weekly production deployment requires a smaller outage to ensure proper redeployment without any inconsistencies.
We expect an outage for up to 15 minutes. There will be no jobs processed from 2025-02-03 15:15 UTC till the successful redeployment.
In case you are affected, please retrigger the jobs accordingly (via comments, or Re-Run button on GitHub Checks) once the outage is over.
Thanks for the understanding.</description>

        <description>There is a New Hotness outage resulting in no Bugzillas about new releases being filed. As a result, no Packit update dist-git pull requests will be created.
There is a workaround: edit your release-monitoring.org project and tick the Check latest release on submit checkbox.
Update: It seems that the issue has been resolved and new release bugzillas are being filed automatically again.</description>

        <description>One of dependencies for our Fedora Messaging consumer has not been installed during the image build which resulted in an outage of the Fedora downstream integration.
Fedora integration is disrupted:
 since 2pm CEST for our stage deployment since 6pm CEST for our production deployment  Please trigger the respective jobs manually, if you are affected, once the outage has been resolved.
We are very sorry for the inconvenience!
Edit #1: Issue has been resolved for both production and staging deployments by rolling back to the previous image builds.</description>

The first step is grouping together related builds and test runs. The migrations will happen during the next deployment to production, on Tuesday February 14 at 2:00AM CET. This set of migrations is expected to take roughly 40 minutes, after which the service should come back up.</description>

        <description>The SLO2 error budget dropped from 85% all the way down to zero in one day. The likely cause was that the fedora-messaging consumer was stuck, so we were not getting messages from Copr about finished SRPM builds. Luckily, the babysit tasks proved to be very useful and caught those later.
We&amp;rsquo;ve added a liveness probe to the messaging consumer to prevent this from happening again.</description>

It will be back on the 2nd of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a wonderful year 2023 everyone! We&amp;rsquo;re back, staging instance is up and serving.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Since the last cluster update, we&amp;rsquo;ve been running our staging instance on a separate node pool which uses AWS Spot instances. It causes the staging instance to be quite unreliable. We&amp;rsquo;re testing it in order to find balance between price and usefulness.</description>

&lt;li&gt;Tue Oct 11 13:12:36 UTC: We have gone through the queue and you should experience regular response times.
The original cause is still not known but the problem probably occured during an SRPM upload to Copr.
(It can be a fault on our or Copr side.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wed Oct 12 05:27:46 UTC: Service operated normally since the last update.
To reduce the chance of this, we &lt;a href=&#34;https://packit.dev/posts/copr-srpms/&#34;&gt;plan to move the building of SRPMs to Copr&lt;/a&gt;.
(Currently default for new installations and opt in for other projects.)&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>(Mostly for our internal use since the source data are not publicly available.)
During the 6 weeks since the beginning of September the SLO1 error budget dropped to 25%. After that (in the middle of October) the trend turned and now, at the end of October, it&amp;rsquo;s at 50%.
When looking at metrics in our (not public) Grafana (Packit boards -&amp;gt; (Prod/Stg) Accepted status time) we can see that the average value (of the &amp;ldquo;accepted status time&amp;rdquo;) indeed increased during the beginning of September by approx 1 second and cases of &amp;gt;15s started to appear so the error budget started to be consumed.</description>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Mostly for our internal use since the source data are not publicly available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 6 weeks since the beginning of September the &lt;a href=&#34;https://packit.dev/docs/service-level-objectives/#slo1-changes-to-github-prs-receive-a-status-update-within-15-seconds-in-99-of-cases&#34;&gt;SLO1&lt;/a&gt;
error budget dropped to 25%. After that (in the middle of October)
the trend turned and now, at the end of October, it&amp;rsquo;s at 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at metrics in our (not public) Grafana
(&lt;code&gt;Packit boards&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;(Prod/Stg) Accepted status time)&lt;/code&gt;
we can see that the average value (of the &amp;ldquo;accepted status time&amp;rdquo;) indeed
increased during the beginning of September by approx 1 second and
cases of &amp;gt;15s started to appear so the error budget started to be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause is yet unknown, but the changes we did the last week of August
and which could thus contribute to the problem were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of SQLAlchemy-related changes - contribution unknown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switched 4 single-threaded workers to 1 multithreaded - there might be some
correlation, but it&amp;rsquo;s not clear because for example the first 2 weeks of October
the change was reverted (i.e. there were again the 4 single-threaded workers)
and even the average value seemed to drop a bit, the error budget continued
to be consumed (meaning there were still some cases of &amp;gt;15s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to continue watching the metrics, experiment with the workers
(numbers and types) and give the changes more time (2 weeks at least)
to be able to tell whether they change the trend.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Our production instance is getting various network issues. In logs, you can see errors with rsync, kerberos and other network related commands. We are sorry about the current state and are investigating the cause. We will let you informed once we know more.
edit: The problem was with one of our task runners. Most probably because of a memory issue we are now trying to find and resolve. The runner was recreated and is working fine currently.</description>

        <description>We had an outage on Tuesday EU night/early morning. Jobs during this time could get stuck in pending state. This was caused by a failed database schema migration because of a lack of memory during the automatic deployment of the new production images. We apologize for the inconvenience.</description>

        <description>Our service got overwhelmed by the events coming from a Fedora dist-git (caused by the epel-9 branching) causing the longer responses.
We have scaled up the workers and the queue is getting shorter. We are planning the next steps to be resilient next time. Sorry about the disturbance.
update: The queue is now empty and you can expect regular operational times.</description>

        <description>We are going to move deployment of our production Packit Service to a new cluster. It should take about 1/2 an hour, during which the workers will be down and queries to API &amp;amp; dashboard won&amp;rsquo;t work properly because the database will be being migrated. Any requests submitted to the API meanwhile should, however, be fulfilled once the workers are up again.</description>

        <description>Building of SRPMs for specific projects needs more memory and blocks the worker for a longer time, this causes other jobs to be slow and delayed. We are working to resolve this in the week of September 13th.</description>
