        <description>There was a Copr outage and as a result Copr builds were stuck in a pending state.
Now the outage is over and any pending jobs should be processed automatically. If they aren&amp;rsquo;t trigger them manually.
However, there is a long queue of builds in Packit and it could take hours for it to decrease.</description>

        <description>Fedora Infrastructure is currently ongoing migration to different datacenter, during this migration majority of the contributor-facing services will be down.
Therefore it is expected that sync-release (i.e., propose-downstream and pull-from-upstream), koji_build, and bodhi_update Packit workflows will be affected.
Copr build jobs may be disrupted, full outage is not expected.
For more details watch:
 Fedora Infrastructure Status Tracking issue for the datacenter move  Update - 4th July Most services in Fedora Infrastructure should be up and running again.</description>

Packit has resumed processing &lt;code&gt;copr_build&lt;/code&gt; jobs, but there are still delays due to jobs being queued during the outage in previous days.
We are continuing to investigate issues related to pushing and pulling from dist-git, which are currently impacting downstream jobs.
We’ll share further updates as soon as we have more information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s weekly production deployment requires a smaller outage to ensure proper redeployment without any inconsistencies.
We expect an outage for up to 15 minutes. There will be no jobs processed from 2025-02-03 15:15 UTC till the successful redeployment.
In case you are affected, please retrigger the jobs accordingly (via comments, or Re-Run button on GitHub Checks) once the outage is over.
Thanks for the understanding.</description>

        <description>There will be a Copr outage starting at
date --date &amp;#34;2023-08-16 12:30 UTC&amp;#34; which will last approximately 2 hours. The build queue processing will be stopped. During the outage time, we expect a very short downtime for the DNF package storage (less than 10 minutes).
Reason for outage: We will update the infrastructure machines to the latest packages that are currently being developed.

        <title>[Resolved] Running grouping migrations</title>
        <link>https://status.packit.dev/issues/2023-02-14-running-grouping-migrations/</link>

        <description>We are updating our database schema to facilitate further development. As a part of this process, multiple database migrations will have to be run. The first step is grouping together related builds and test runs. The migrations will happen during the next deployment to production, on Tuesday February 14 at 2:00AM CET. This set of migrations is expected to take roughly 40 minutes, after which the service should come back up.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since significant refactoring was paired with these changes, there may
be some bugs/regressions that we did not spot on staging. Please,
contact us via the usual means if you spot anything suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tue Oct 11 12:24:02 UTC: We are slowly going through the queue. Please, be patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tue Oct 11 13:12:36 UTC: We have gone through the queue and you should experience regular response times.
The original cause is still not known but the problem probably occured during an SRPM upload to Copr.
(It can be a fault on our or Copr side.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wed Oct 12 05:27:46 UTC: Service operated normally since the last update.
To reduce the chance of this, we &lt;a href=&#34;https://packit.dev/posts/copr-srpms/&#34;&gt;plan to move the building of SRPMs to Copr&lt;/a&gt;.
(Currently default for new installations and opt in for other projects.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
