        <description>Fedora Infrastructure is currently ongoing migration to different datacenter, during this migration majority of the contributor-facing services will be down.
Therefore it is expected that sync-release (i.e., propose-downstream and pull-from-upstream), koji_build, and bodhi_update Packit workflows will be affected.
Copr build jobs may be disrupted, full outage is not expected.
For more details watch:

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;update---4th-july&#34;&gt;Update - 4th July&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most services in Fedora Infrastructure should be up and running again.
Packit has resumed processing &lt;code&gt;copr_build&lt;/code&gt; jobs, but there are still delays due to jobs being queued during the outage in previous days.
We are continuing to investigate issues related to pushing and pulling from dist-git, which are currently impacting downstream jobs.
Weâ€™ll share further updates as soon as we have more information.&lt;/p&gt;
