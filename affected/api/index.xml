        <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s weekly production deployment requires a smaller outage to ensure proper redeployment without any inconsistencies.
We expect an outage for up to 15 minutes. There will be no jobs processed from 2025-02-03 15:15 UTC till the successful redeployment.
In case you are affected, please retrigger the jobs accordingly (via comments, or Re-Run button on GitHub Checks) once the outage is over.
Thanks for the understanding.</description>

        <description>Database volume needs to be enlarged to accomodate the load on the Packit Service. To minimize the amount of jobs affected by this maintenance there will be no jobs processed, but they should be enqueued until the outage is over.
In case you are affected, please retrigger the jobs accordingly (via comment on the affected pull requests, or Re-Run button on GitHub Checks).
Thanks for understanding.</description>

        <description>Packit production instance has lost access to GitLab API. This most likely affects also self-hosted GitLab forges.
The issue has been resolved and everything should work as expected.</description>

        <description>We are having an outage that started on Tuesday EU early morning. Jobs during this time could get stuck in pending state. This is caused by a failed database schema migration because of a lack of memory during the automatic deployment of the new production images. We are working on the fix and apologize for the inconvenience.
Update: Migration is completed. You might need to retrigger the jobs (i.e. via comment).</description>

        <description>We are running a DB maintenance in order to clean up old pipelines. We expect API performance to improve as a result of this.
The maintenance window is planned for an hour, the actual clean up activities will last approximately 20 minutes. Users might experience degraded performance of the service and dashboard during this time.</description>

        <description>We are updating our database schema to facilitate further development. As a part of this process, multiple database migrations will have to be run. The first step is grouping together related builds and test runs. The migrations will happen during the next deployment to production, on Tuesday February 14 at 2:00AM CET. This set of migrations is expected to take roughly 40 minutes, after which the service should come back up.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since significant refactoring was paired with these changes, there may
be some bugs/regressions that we did not spot on staging. Please,
contact us via the usual means if you spot anything suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>We are going to move deployment of our production Packit Service to a new cluster. It should take about 1/2 an hour, during which the workers will be down and queries to API &amp;amp; dashboard won&amp;rsquo;t work properly because the database will be being migrated. Any requests submitted to the API meanwhile should, however, be fulfilled once the workers are up again.</description>
