        <description>One of dependencies for our Fedora Messaging consumer has not been installed during the image build which resulted in an outage of the Fedora downstream integration.
Fedora integration is disrupted:
 since 2pm CEST for our stage deployment since 6pm CEST for our production deployment  Please trigger the respective jobs manually, if you are affected, once the outage has been resolved.
We are very sorry for the inconvenience!
Edit #1: Issue has been resolved for both production and staging deployments by rolling back to the previous image builds.</description>
