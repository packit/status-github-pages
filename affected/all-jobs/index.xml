        <description>Packit Service was overflown with tasks (most likely caused by Copr having trouble starting builds), hit resource limits and as a result stopped processing tasks for about 9 hours. We&amp;rsquo;ve increased resources and got things running, but it will take a while before the accumulated queue of tasks is processed and things get back to normal.
Update: the queue has been processed, everything should be back to normal.</description>
