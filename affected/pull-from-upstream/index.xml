        <description>There is a New Hotness outage resulting in no Bugzillas about new releases being filed. As a result, no Packit update dist-git pull requests will be created.
There is a workaround: edit your release-monitoring.org project and tick the Check latest release on submit checkbox.
Update: It seems that the issue has been resolved and new release bugzillas are being filed automatically again.</description>

        <description>One of dependencies for our Fedora Messaging consumer has not been installed during the image build which resulted in an outage of the Fedora downstream integration.
Fedora integration is disrupted:
 since 2pm CEST for our stage deployment since 6pm CEST for our production deployment  Please trigger the respective jobs manually, if you are affected, once the outage has been resolved.
We are very sorry for the inconvenience!
Edit #1: Issue has been resolved for both production and staging deployments by rolling back to the previous image builds.</description>

        <title>[Resolved] Fedora infrastructure authentication problem</title>
        <link>https://status.packit.dev/issues/2024-02-26-fedora-auth-problem/</link>

        <description>There is a problem with authentication in Fedora Infrastructure, leading to failures of jobs that interact with it (mostly propose_downstream, pull_from_upstream, koji_build, bodhi_update) as Packit is unable to authenticate. To stay updated on the root cause of this problem, please track this issue.
The problem should be now resolved. You can retrigger the failed jobs by:
 /packit propose-downstream comment in any upstream issue /packit pull-from-upstream / /packit koji-build / /packit create-update comment in any dist-git pull-request  </description>
