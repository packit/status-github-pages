        <description>Testing Farm had an outage caused by the provisioner going down. The outage has been addressed, you can see more details: https://status.testing-farm.io/issues/2025-12-16-public-ranch-outage/.
Testing jobs should now be able to be processed, but there is a backlog of testing requests in Testing Farm, which may take a few hours to be processed.</description>

        <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s weekly production deployment requires a smaller outage to ensure proper redeployment without any inconsistencies.
We expect an outage for up to 15 minutes. There will be no jobs processed from 2025-02-03 15:15 UTC till the successful redeployment.
In case you are affected, please retrigger the jobs accordingly (via comments, or Re-Run button on GitHub Checks) once the outage is over.
Thanks for the understanding.</description>

        <description>Database volume needs to be enlarged to accomodate the load on the Packit Service. To minimize the amount of jobs affected by this maintenance there will be no jobs processed, but they should be enqueued until the outage is over.
In case you are affected, please retrigger the jobs accordingly (via comment on the affected pull requests, or Re-Run button on GitHub Checks).

        <description>After the deployment of the new version of Testing Farm, you may have encountered Testing Farm runs that fail with the status Failed to checkout ref {sha}. Together with the Testing Farm team, we are working on a fix.</description>

        <title>[Resolved] Running grouping migrations</title>

        <description>We are updating our database schema to facilitate further development. As a part of this process, multiple database migrations will have to be run. The first step is grouping together related builds and test runs. The migrations will happen during the next deployment to production, on Tuesday February 14 at 2:00AM CET. This set of migrations is expected to take roughly 40 minutes, after which the service should come back up.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since significant refactoring was paired with these changes, there may
be some bugs/regressions that we did not spot on staging. Please,
contact us via the usual means if you spot anything suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Testing Farm infrastructure had an outage which caused the status of the test runs to be stuck in the queued state. This is now resolved and tests can be retriggered by /packit test comment command in the pull requests.</description>

        <description>Due to a wide outage in Red Hat internal infrastructure the Red Hat Ranch (=internal ranch) is disabled in the Testing Farm (=our test runner). Currently there is no ETA for resolving the problem. Follow the progress on the Testing Farm status page: https://status.testing-farm.io/issues/2022-10-10-redhat-ranch/</description>

        <description>Testing Farm is failing to run tests submitted by Packit which use Copr builds. Tests with the skip_build flag are not be affected by this issue. We are working together with the Testing Farm team to fix this as soon as possible.</description>
